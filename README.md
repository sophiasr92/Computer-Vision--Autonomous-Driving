# Computer-Vision--Autonomous-Driving
Based on the Kaggle Competition Peking University/Baidu - Autonomous Driving
Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/pku-autonomous-driving/data

Predicting vehicle angle in different settings for the autonomous driving system. 
Developed an algorithm to estimate the absolute pose of vehicles from a single image in a real-world traffic environment using CenterNet as a baseline model which models an object as a single point which is the center
point of a bounding box.
Implemented various regularization methods such as data augmentation, early stopping, image preprocessing
technique, GCN and tuned the various hyperparameters to improve the performance and reduce overfitting.
